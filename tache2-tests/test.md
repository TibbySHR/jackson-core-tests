# InputCoercionException

Class Location: jackson-core/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/exc/InputCoercionException.java

## Justification for Tested Methods:
1. **Constructor and Property Accessors**: It is essential to verify that the input and target types provided during instantiation are correctly stored and can be accessed using `getInputType()` and `getTargetType()`.
2. **withParser Method**: This method updates the internal parser reference in the exception, and it is important to ensure that it functions as expected.
3. **Exception Message**: Verifying the exception message ensures that the error information provided during instantiation is correctly preserved and returned.

These tests ensure that exception handling works correctly and covers key functionalities of the `InputCoercionException` class.


# MatchStrength

Class Location: jackson-core/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/format/MatchStrength.java

###Justification for Tested Methods:

1. **Enum Order and Existence**:
   - **Why Tested**: The correct order and presence of enum values are critical for ensuring that Jacksonâ€™s data format detection works as intended. Testing verifies that the values are present and in the correct order.

2. **Enum Descriptions (toString)**:
   - **Why Tested**: Ensuring that `toString()` returns the correct enum name is crucial for debugging and logging purposes. Testing ensures that each value has a consistent and expected string representation.

3. **Switch-Case Handling**:
   - **Why Tested**: Java enums are often used in switch-case statements. It is important to verify that the `MatchStrength` enum can be used in this manner and that the correct branch is executed for each value.


These tests ensure proper handling and validation of `MatchStrength`, increasing code stability and coverage.
